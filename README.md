# Java Class to Object Decorator

This project demonstrates a lightweight, annotation-driven framework for dynamically decorating Java objects—especially EJB and JMS resources—at runtime. It is primarily intended for use in testing environments where dynamic behavior injection is needed without altering the core codebase.

## Features

- Decorate Java objects at runtime using custom annotations
- Extendable architecture for different resource types (e.g., EJB, JMS)
- Minimal dependencies, using reflection and Java EE interfaces
- Modular and testable
